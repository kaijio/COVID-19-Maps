# Lab 2: COVID-19-Maps

In this Lab, I created 2 web maps which show COVID-19 rates and total cases for the United States. These web maps were created with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The basemap for both of these maps are from MapBox. Map 1 is a proportional symbol map to depict the total number of COVID-19 cases by county. When you click on a bubble, it have have a pop-up which contains the exact number of cases for that county. The data used in Map 1 comes from The New York Times. Map 2 is a choropleth map to depict the COVID-19 rate per 1000 people in each county. Clicking on a county will pop-up a window containing the exact rate for the county. The population data used in Map 2 to calculate COVID-19 rates is from the U.S. Census Bureau ACS 5 year estimates.
