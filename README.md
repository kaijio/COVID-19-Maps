# Lab 2: COVID-19-Maps

In this Lab, I created 2 web maps which show COVID-19 rates and total cases for the United States. These web maps were created with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Map 1 is a proportional symbol map to depict the total number of COVID-19 cases by county. When you click on a bubble, it have have a pop-up which contains the exact number of cases for that county. The data used in Map 1 comes from The New York Times. Map 2 is a choropleth map to depict the COVID-19 rate per 1000 people in each county. Clicking on a county will pop-up a window containing the exact rate for the county. The population data used in Map 2 to calculate COVID-19 rates is from the U.S. Census Bureau ACS 5 year estimates.
